# Exercise 2: working with data frames

# Create a vector of 100 employees ("Employee 1", "Employee 2", ... "Employee 100")
# Hint: use the `paste()` function and vector recycling to add a number to the word
# "Employee"
employees <- c(paste("employee", 1:100))
print(employees)

# Create a vector of 100 random salaries for the year 2017
# Use the `runif()` function to pick random numbers between 40000 and 50000
salary <- c(runif(100, 40000, 50000))

# Create a vector of 100 annual salary adjustments between -5000 and 10000.
# (A negative number represents a salary decrease due to corporate greed)
# Again use the `runif()` function to pick 100 random numbers in that range.
adjustments <- c(runif(100, -5000, 10000))

# Create a data frame `salaries` by combining the 3 vectors you just made
# Remember to set `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`!
salaries <-data.frame(employees, salary, adjustments, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
print(salaries)

# Add a column to the `salaries` data frame that represents each person's
# salary in 2018 (e.g., with the salary adjustment added in).
salaries$adjusted_salary <- salaries$salary + salaries$adjustments
print(salaries)

# Add a column to the `salaries` data frame that has a value of `TRUE` if the 
# person got a raise (their salary went up)
salaries$raise <- salaries$adjustments > 0
print(salaries)

### Retrieve values from your data frame to answer the following questions
### Note that you should get the value as specific as possible (e.g., a single
### cell rather than the whole row!)

# What was the 2018 salary of Employee 57
print(salaries[salaries$employees == "employee 57", "adjusted_salary"])

# How many employees got a raise?
nrow(salaries[salaries$raise == TRUE, ])

# What was the dollar value of the highest raise?
highest_raise <- max(salaries$adjustments)

# What was the "name" of the employee who received the highest raise?
salaries[salaries$adjustments == highest_raise, "employees"]

# What was the largest decrease in salaries between the two years?
lowest_raise <- min(salaries$adjustments)

# What was the name of the employee who recieved largest decrease in salary?
salaries[salaries$adjustments == lowest_raise, "employees"]

# What was the average salary change?
mean(salaries$adjustments)

# For people who did not get a raise, how much money did they lose on average?
mean(salaries[salaries$raise == FALSE, "adjustments"])

## Consider: do the above averages match what you expected them to be based on 
## how you generated the salaries?

# Write a .csv file of your salary data to your working directory
write.csv(salaries, ".//.//./example.csv")
